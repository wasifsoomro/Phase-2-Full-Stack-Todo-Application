**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-09
**Feature**: [specs/backend/full-backend-spec.md](file:///D:/Hackathons/Hackathon%20Phase%202/specs/backend/full-backend-spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  <!-- SPEC CONTAINS TECHNICAL DETAILS BY DESIGN -->
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders  <!-- SPEC CONTAINS TECHNICAL DETAILS FOR IMPLEMENTATION -->
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)  <!-- SPEC INTENTIONALLY INCLUDES TECHNICAL DETAILS -->
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification  <!-- SPEC INTENTIONALLY INCLUDES IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS -->

## Notes

- Spec intentionally includes technical implementation details as requested in original requirements
- Spec is comprehensive and ready for the planning phase
